	<h1>Welcome to the website, Ian, Jack, you little bitches</h1>
	<h2>This site's purpose</h2>
	<p>Do what you want, send it to me and i'll put it on here. I dont know shit about css or html. ONE RULE, NO JAVASCRIPT!!!! Why? Fuck you. Also, I'm trying to get IRC working but that bitch is kinda fucked. There are too many damn wizards on my block. Shit is getting annoying for real, Like a nigga cant even walk to the store anymore without a fucking wizard casting a fireball and setting my path ablaze like come the fuck on dude. Are you for real, this is the shit a nigga gotta deal with now you're just gonna set my path ablaze just like that? Alright dawg I gotchu watch this. I whip out my own spell book (I was a wizard the whole time) and cast whirlwind to make a fire tornado and then send it right back at his bitch ass. Abra cadabra my dick in your mouth, fuck nigga.</p>
